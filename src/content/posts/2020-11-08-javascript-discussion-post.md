Part 1

1. This article goes over some of the basic, javascript specific things that you need to know to code in javascript. Some of these things are let and const variables, arrow functions, and classes.
2. This article was very well written; it explained different basic javascript elements that you'll need to know to code in javascript and it also gave code examples of how to use them. This article did a good job of explaining the basic elements of javascript, but this article isn't going to teach someone with no prior knowledge of javascript how to code in javascript. This article doesn't go over the basic coding knowledge you need to know, such as how to use if statements and loops. It's unrealistic to think that you could learn to code using javascript by reading one article, so I would definitely recommend this article to students who have prior knowledge of javascript. If you don't have prior knowledge of javascript then this article might also be helpful in showing you what can be used in javascript.
